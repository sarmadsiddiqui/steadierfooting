I'm Sarmad Siddiqui. This blog is to primarily talk about technology, tennis, and TV. It's not exactly frequently updated.


The site is called ‘Steadier Footing’. It’s the title of a song from a band I’m quite fond of, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DCFCtv">Death</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deathcabforcutie">Cab</a> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/death-cab-for-cutie/id5448636">For</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Cab-for-Cutie/e/B000APLFOU/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1299703127&amp;sr=8-2-ent">Cutie</a>. After a lot of thought, I concluded this was an appropriate title for this site. I hope they don’t mind. Listen through here (<a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=death%20cab%20for%20cutie%20steadier%20footing">link</a>). Buy here (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steadier-Footing/dp/B000S518PI/ref=sr_1_2?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311487401&amp;sr=1-2">link</a>).
