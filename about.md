I'm Sarmad Siddiqui. This blog is to primarily talk about technology, tennis, and TV. It's not exactly frequently updated.


The site's title &mdash;*Steadier Footing*&mdash; is inspired by a song from [Death Cab for Cutie](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=canonical&q=death+cab+for+cutie), a band Iâ€™m quite fond of. If you haven't heard them, [give them a listen at their Bandcamp site](https://deathcabforcutie.bandcamp.com/music) or [try their NPR Tiny Desk set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi6uRT7PxTQ)!

Cheers,

Sarmad
